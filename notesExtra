1
added an abstract class TotalRevenueTemplate in view package with the pseudocode
it implements the observer
implement it in the observers instead of the interface
remove reportSaleRevenue override in the observers

2
Took approach similar to the example, used HashSet.
Composed was more code, but with more control, needs more code to implement a larger chunk of the Set it builds on.
Inherited didn't even have to override the addAll, since the implementation upstream uses the add method

..but my main method doesn't print?
created ViewTest
reassign System.out to a stream we can manipulate (well, programmatically read from);

testing view is VERY tricky since everything but the constructor is private..
It really is no different here than testing main itself.

created MainTest
om main printar "---Ready To Scan---" s√• har main startat programmet som den ska.


VieTest
Output is quite large so put the expected output in a text file
It does the comparison line by line, and skips specific lines tha includes timestamps
as they will differ every rum.

this means the only way we can glean output is by running the constructor.


CartPrintTest
test the printing of the cart
